    "3. The Brookhaven AGS experiment measured the relative decay angle between opposite sign pions produced from a beam of neutral long lived kaons, $K_{\\mathrm{L}}^0$. Typically $K_{\\mathrm{L}}^0$ mesons will decay into three pions $\\left(\\pi^{ \\pm}, \\pi^{-}, \\pi^0\\right)$, thus the distribution of the decay angle between the charged pair will be flat. The experiment was searching for two pion decays of the $K_{\\mathrm{L}}^0$ meson, in which case the decay angle between the charged pair is $\\pi$."
